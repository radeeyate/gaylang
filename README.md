# gaylang

gaylang is a "programming language" written in Python meant to be a joke, and written in pride month because I was bored.

## Syntax

All programs must start with `🌈 pride 🏳️‍🌈` and end with `🌈end🏳️‍🌈`. 

### Variable Declaration

To declare a variable, you would write `💃my variable is <content>💃`. Variable names can container any character besides 💃, 🌈, or 🏳️‍🌈. 
Variables values can be inclosed `"` for strings, and without `"` for integers.

Valid Gaylang variable declaration would look like this:

```
💃integer is 1876💃
💃string is "Hello, world!"💃
```

### Code execution

When executing code, you enclose it inside `🔥yaaaas💃` and end with `🔥end💃`. All code besides variable declaration currently goes inside `yaaaas` blocks.

#### Printing of text

Inside of `yaaaas` blocks, you can print text.

Printing strings:
When printing strings, this is the syntax: `🌈say "Hello, World!"🎉`.

Printing variables:
When printing variables, this is the syntax: `🌈tell 💃variable_name🌈🎉`.

#### Clearning the screen

You can clear the screen inside of `yaaaas` blocks. The syntax is: `🌈clear🌈`.
